sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Merge sort and bubble sort should take similar times when going through an already sorted array, but bubble sort should be considerably slower when going through
a fully random one. So by testing the algorithms on sorted50k and random50k, I was able to identify which is which.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort takes about the same time to sort numbers no matter how they are disposed because it wil always look at all the numbers
in the array on every iteration. Besides that, it should be the slowest one when going through a sorted array because it has to go through the hole array at
every iteration.
So by testing the algorithms on random50k and sorted50k, the only one that behaved this way was the sort3.
