## Description
This is a repository for my solutions on the labs and problem sets from Harvard's CS50 Course.

## Notes:
For every week of the course, there is a folder with my solutions for the problem sets from that particular week.

Every lab or problem set folder contains a short description of the problems and a link for the full descriptions.

Every code has been tested and works exactly like it's supposed to, meeting all the problems' requirements.
