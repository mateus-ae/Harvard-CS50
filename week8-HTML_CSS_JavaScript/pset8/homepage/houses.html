					Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is divided into four Houses: Gryffindor, founded by Godric Gryffindor; Hufflepuff, 
					founded by Helga Hufflepuff; Ravenclaw, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw; and Slytherin, founded by Salazar Slytherin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Houses at Hogwarts are both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same 
					House shares the same dormitory and many classes. The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. 
					Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It is important to remember that your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. 
					At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. The House with the most points wins 
					the House Cup. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would
					be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each "put some brains" in it, creating the <strong>Sorting Hat</strong>
					to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on each new student's 
					head during the Sorting ceremony.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Sorting Hat announces the House the student is to join. Before beginning the Sorting ceremony, it sings a short song about the founding
					of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs are different every year, and the Hat is said to take all year composing the next one.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It is unclear if the Sorting Hat tends to place students based on qualities they value or rather qualities they exhibit, 
					but it can detect nascent qualities in a student and place them in the House that will challenge them and put their character to the test.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Hat also appeared to take the student's wishes into account, considering how one's personal choices are very much a reflection of the 
					qualities that they value in themselves. However, just because someone is placed in a certain House does not mean that they could not display 
					characteristics of other Houses.
