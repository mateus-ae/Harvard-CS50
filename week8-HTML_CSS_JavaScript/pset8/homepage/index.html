					Usually, we do not do things on the muggle's internet, but since we are facing a pandemic situation that has also reached the wizarding
					world, we are giving it a try and soon we will be in touch with more information about the next steps for your admission. 
					But enough of that, let us introduce you to our amazing school...

					Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepts magical
					students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment.It is a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world,
					and we will teach everything you need to know to become a great wizard.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is divided into four Houses. Houses at Hogwarts are both the living and learning 
					communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shares the same dormitory and many classes. 
					The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has 
					produced outstanding witches and wizards.
				</p>	
				
				<p>
					While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. 
					At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. The House with the most points wins 
					the House Cup. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. To learn more about the houses
