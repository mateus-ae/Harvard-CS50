				<p>
					Hufflepuff values hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play. 
					Its emblematic animal is the badger, and yellow and black are its colours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pomona Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991â€“1998, Sprout left the post of Head 
					of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her successor for the position 
					of Head of Hufflepuff is currently undefined.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Fat Friar is its ghost. The founder of the House was Helga Hufflepuff.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hufflepuff corresponds to the element of earth.
				
				<p>
					The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room are located somewhere in the basement, near the 
					castle's kitchens. It can be accessed by tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of 
					the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff" and is described as being a cosy and welcoming
					place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that leads to the dormitories, 
					which have perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Famous Hufflepuffs include Hengist of Woodcroft (founder of Hogsmeade), Newt Scamander (author of 
					Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and Artemisia Lufkin (first female minister for magic).
