get input from user
if input has less than 13 digits, credit card number is invalid. Print "INVALID"
if input has more than 16 digits, credit card number is invalid (but the get long function will reprompt user automatically)
separate digits from the input ( maybe use modulo division)
apply the luhn's algorithm to check if the number is valid
if number is valid, than check the conditions to find out what card type it is
if it's not valid, than print "INVALID"
